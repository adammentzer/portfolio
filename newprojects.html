  <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">UX Analysis - Slack</h2>
  <p class = "whitelink">One of my assignments for SI 110 was to do a design analysis of a website, mobile 	application, 
    or social media platform with respect to Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics for User Experience Design. 
    I chose to review the desktop version of Slack. 
      </br>
      </br>
    As the  pandemic necessitated heavy Slack use for school, I had curated a list of inadequacies (at least by my standards) in 
     its interface and was eager to showcase what I’d learned thus far in the class. 
     My main complaint was that it lacked a “landing page” for the user, as it instead constantly 
     forces the user to be in one of their workspaces. This violates Nielsen's Third Heuristic, as it inhibits user freedom, control, and
     desire to explore the application. In other words, should the user lose their place in the interface or make a mistake, there are no spaces for the user to have a high-level overview of their
     workspaces nor are there any exits for them to “crash land” to. This decreases the user's confidence and makes them apprehensive about trying new capabilities of the application.
      </br>
      </br>
      Among my other concerns were that some of the icons don’t represent what you would conventionally expect them to, 
      the tendency for the screen to get cluttered with information, and that Slack seemed to cater towards power 
      users rather than the average person.</p>

    <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Priority Queues, Pairing Heaps, and Video Games</h2>
    <p class = "whiteproj"> Simulated a video game in which the player (the user) 
      is supposed to choose the highest-priority enemy to defeat through the implementation of priority queues using custom comparators. 
      Additionally, the player could specify output modes that would detail previous player 
      actions and enemy statistics 
      (median lifespan, longest-living enemies, etc.) by implementing the aforementioned data structures in other ways. The second half of this project
    was implementing a binary heap, unordered priority queue, and a pairing heap without the use of the C++ STL.</p>

      <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Natural Language Processing Content Classifier (Piazza)</h2>
      <p class = "whiteproj">Built program that employs machine learning and natural language processing techiques  to predict the topics of online forum posts, 
        correctly labeling 87% of 2,988 real posts.
        Architected and developed program in C++ using maps and binary search trees.
        Learned about various machine learning models, choosing the most efficient solution for the classification task.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Zookeeper Pathway Optimization</h2>
      <p class = "whiteproj">Built a program that implemented a modified version of Prim’s algorithm to construct a minimum spanning
         tree while avoiding a predefined "danger zone" that could
        only be added to the tree if certain constraints were satisfied. Other capabilities of program included solving the Traveling Salesperson
        Problem through a branch-and-bound algorithm. The user could select for a more quickly retrieved yet suboptimal solution (nearest arbitrary 
        insertion TSP heuristic).
      </p>  
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Logfile Management</h2>
      <p class = "whiteproj">Created a tool for storing, sorting, and generating log file reports where the user can search by category, keyword, and timestamp (single timestamp or a range). This project emphasized algorithmic 
        runtime efficiency as well as taking advantage of the C++ STL 
        in order to create the simplest and quickest solution.</p>  
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Web Backend</h2>
        <p class = "whiteproj">Built a virtual office hours application for EECS 280 where the program would read and write HTTP subsets to handle requests pertaining to a queue of students/student information (name, position in queue, phyiscal location). 
          As the goal of this project was to introduce students to working with APIs and creating web applications, 
          this program was able to be hosted on a web server upon completion.</p>

      <div>
        <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Three-Dimensional Puzzle</h2>
        <p class = "whiteproj">  Implemented a backtracing algorithm to search for an endpoint given an arbitrary starting point in 
          three-dimensional puzzles (sizes ranging from 4 tile spaces to 7 million), using custom data structures to allow for multiple modes
            of both input and output (coordinate list and map).</p>

        <div>
          <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Computer Vision</h2>
          <p class = "whiteproj">Achieved content-aware image resizing with the use of a seam-carving algorithm, where the program took four arguments
          (input filename, output filename, desired width, and desired height) and used two matrices to identify the "lowest-priority" pixels and 
            then modify the image.

        <div>
          <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Euche Simulation</h2>
          <p class = "whiteproj">Built a program to simulate euchre, a card game popular in the state of Michigan. 
            Key components of this project included implementing algorithms for shuffling/dealing cards, 
            defining card values in relation to one another, 
            and using polymorphism/derived classes to create a protocol for the computer-controlled players that the user could 
            compete against.</p>

          <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Event Seating</h2>
          <p class = "whiteproj">At my cousin’s wedding reception this past July, I was looking around at all of the 	tables trying to figure out if there was any rhyme or reason to the seating arrangements.  	
            Some tables were completely full (or even overfilled), 
            while others had plenty of vacant seats. 
            When she came around to my family’s table, I asked my cousin how she had arranged all of us. 
            She said that she and my new cousin-in-law had done the seating by hand, and that it was a 
            massive pain to take into account the different groups of people as well as the number of chairs/tables available to them. 
            Wanting to brush up on my Python skills, I decided that I’d make a tool for creating seating arrangements with 
            groups manually inputted by the user. The user could also sort people in different ways, such as:
            <br>
            <br>
            a) optimizing for a given number of chairs at each table
            <br>
            b) finding how many people should be seated with a given number of tables
            <br>
            c) having the program determine how many chairs/tables are needed based on the average group size
            <br>
            d) letting each larger-than-average group get its own table, even though this increases the amount of empty seats 
          <br>
          <br>
          Each of these options would print out what groups were at each table and who was in each group. Additionally, the program was designed so 
          that the number of open seats at each table was minimized and so that as few groups as 
          possible needed special accommodation (for each user preference).
          <br>
          <br>
          Having furthered my education since creating this project, I am currently working 
          on implementing disjoint sets to make sure that only people who know each other 
          (e.g. bride’s family/groom’s family) are seated together.</p>

          <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">Boredom Fighter</h2>
          <p class = "whiteproj">Like a lot of people, I hate being bored and feeling stagnant. Even when I have free time, I often face a lapse in creativity or decision paralysis where I feel like I just can’t find something to do. After describing this problem to a friend, they referenced <a href = "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220736" style = "color: white;">this study about external reinforcement in decision making </a> 
            and how it helped them make their own decisions. 
            Knowing this, I resolved to create an app that would TELL me what to do when I was 
            bored rather than having to come up with something myself. 
            Because it wasn’t my own idea to shoot down, it was harder to refuse. 
          <br>
          <br>
            Aside from the reasons above, the purpose of this project was to introduce myself to Swift and 
            SwiftUI for iOS development.

          <h2 class = "whitelink" style = "text-decoration: underline;">This Website!</h2>
          <p class = "whiteproj">In its original incarnation, this website was my final project for SI 339 (Web Design, Development, and Accessibility), 
            with the goal of the project being to display what I had learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript that semester. Requirements included mobile-first responsive design using flexbox/grid,
            animations, contact forms, and embedded content.
