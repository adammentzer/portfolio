    <div>
    <p class = "whiteproj">Hi! I'm Adam Mentzer, a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan hoping to work as an 
      engineer after graduation in 2023.
    </br> 
  </br> 
      As someone who stutters, I constantly reflect on ways to make the content of my speech smoother, 
      more fluid, and more easily understood. 
      Perhaps this tendency is the reason I strive to use holistic approaches to help make products truly
      conform to the user's needs and that provide tangible value.
    </br> 
  </br> 
      As a student at the University of Michigan, 
      I'm taught how to analyze problems and find their solutions, but the most important lessons
       I've learned are from those who I work with, as the most valuable part of being at Michigan 
       is the empowering opportunity to draw on the knowledge and experiences of others so that I can
       create as much authentic impact as possible.
      </br> 
      </br> 
      In my spare time, I love watch to the NFL and Formula 1, while the rest of 
      my weekends are usually spent record shopping with my friends and exploring Ann Arbor through long bike rides -- 
      if you're in the area and need to know where to find the best parks, shop, or eat, I'm your guy.
    </br>
